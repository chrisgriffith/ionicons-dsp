## Feedback

For questions, issues or feedback, please file an [issue here](https://github.com/chrisgriffith/ionicons-dsp/issues).

## How can I use the package?

Please use the [Adobe XD extension for VS Code](https://letsxd.com/vscode) to open this and other DSPs.
After installing the Adobe Spectrum DSP with npm, open the Adobe XD extension for VS Code, and select `Load package`.
Then navigate to your `node_modules` folder, and select the `adobe-spectrum-dsp` folder (DSPs contain a dsp.json file at the root level). If possible, watch the short [Adobe XD extension for VS Code Learn Videos](https://letsxd.com/vscode) to know how to consume what is available in the DSP package.
